Directory for building a CCES cumulative file (2006 - 2016) collaboratively. Follow the development of dataset building at [this Github page](https://github.com/kuriwaki/cces_cumulative). Project page of tasks [here](https://github.com/kuriwaki/cces_cumulative/projects/1).

A 2006-2012 cumulative file, as well as datasets from individual years, can be found at the CCES homepage: https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/

Please feel free to file any questions or requests about the cumulative file as [Github issues](https://github.com/kuriwaki/cces_cumulative/issues). 

Data is currently not tracked, but releases will be made as flat files and a [Crunch dataset](crunch.io). For an intermediate dataset, please [email](mailto:kuriwaki@g.harvard.edu).




## Structure of the directory


### code
- `build` stores code that is used to wrangle data and build datasets
- `analyze` stores code to visualize and analyze data.
- `old_code` for code that is out of use

### data
- `data/source` is where all the input data is. Things in here should not be overwritten. Instead, manipulated output should go in `data/output`.
- `data/source/cces` stores all the CCES common content material.
- `data/source/census` stores all the census-related data, and so on.

Note: most _data_ files are not tracked on git.


### other references
- `figures` for generated figures
- `tables` for generated tables
- `guides` stores all the codebooks, guides, etc.. to explain the common content.



## Main code

- `build/01_pull-08to11.R` pulls out some variables that we need separately from 2008 - 2011 CCES common content, that was masked in the 2006-2012 cumulative file.
- `build/02_stack.R` pulls out the variabales of interest from annual CCES files. Then, we stack this into a long dataset where each row is a respondent from CCES. This is uploaded to Crunch.
- `build/09_format-crunch.R` logs into Crunch, and adds variable names, descriptions, groupings, and other Crunch attributes to the Crunch dataset.
