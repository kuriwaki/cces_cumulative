Source code for building a CCES cumulative file (2006 - 2016). Please feel free to file any questions or requests about the cumulative file as [Github issues](https://github.com/kuriwaki/cces_cumulative/issues). 


A 2006-2012 cumulative file, as well as datasets from individual years, can be found at the CCES homepage: https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/


Data is currently not tracked, but releases will be made as flat files in the CCES [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/cces) and a [Crunch dataset](crunch.io). 

Current Dataverse Version: 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/II2DB6

# Getting Started 

The `.Rds` format^[In contrast to a csv, this R format preserves dataset properties such as the distinction between integers and doubles, and labelled variables.] can be read into R.

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
df <- readRDS(find_rstudio_root_file("data/release/cumulative_2006_2016.Rds"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- readRDS("cumulative_2006_2016.Rds")
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df
```

Each row is a respondent, and each variable is information associated with that respondent. Note that this cumulative dataset extracts only a couple of key variables from each year's CCES, which has hundreds of columns. 



# What's New

## Unified Variable Names

Most variables in this dataset come straight from each year's CCES. However, it renames and standardizes variable names, making them accessible in one place. 

Please see the guide or the Crunch dataset for a full list and description of variables. 



## Candidate Names and Identifiers
One addition to this cumulative dataset above the individual years that comprise it is the addition of candidate name and identifiers that a respondent chose. In the individual year's CCES datasets, typically the response values for a vote choice question is a generic label, e.g. `Candidate1` and `Candidate2`. Then, separate variables with those names are appended, requiring users to look-up the relevant candidate for each respondent. The cumulative dataset shows both the generic label _and_ the chosen candidate's name, party, and identifier, which will vary across individuals. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
select(df, year, case_id, matches("voted_sen"))
```



## Crunch

A version of the dataset is also included in Crunch, a database platform that makes it easy to view and analyze survey data either with our without any programming experience.  For access to View the dataset (free), please sign up here: <https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_066hQi4Eeco3Kap>. Some features include:


### A web GUI for quickly browsing variables

### Quickly check cross-tabs and bar graphs, with customizable formatting

![Cross-tabulate Variables with Crunch](guide/02_crunch_tab.gif)

### Sharable widgets.  


For questions and more access, please contact the CCES Team.


Crunch datasets can also be manipulated from a R package, `crunch`: <https://github.com/Crunch-io/rcrunch>. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("crunch")
```


For a bit more on using the R crunch package for your own purposes, see the crunch package vignettes, pkgdown website, or a short vignette in this repo. 


# Code Organization

R scripts `01` - `06` reproduce the cumulative dataset starting from each year's CCES on dataverse. 

- `01_define-names-labels.R` constructs two variable name tables -- one that names and describes each variable to be in the final dataset, and another that indicates which variables corresponds to the candidate columns in each year's CCES.
- `02_read-common.R` pulls out the common contents with minimal formatting (e.g. state, case identifier variable names)
- `03_prepare-fixes.R` makes some fixes to variables in each year's datasets.
- `04_stack-cumulative.R` pulls out the variables of interest from annual CCES files, we stack this into a long dataset where each row is a respondent from CCES.
- `05_extract_contextual.R` pulls out the "contextual variables" at the respondent-level. information on candidates and representatives. It uses some long format voting tables from `04`.
- `06_merge-contextual_upload.R` combines all the variables together, essentially combining the output of `04` on `05`. Saves a `.Rds` and `sav` version. 
- `07_format-crunch.R` logs into Crunch, and adds variable names, descriptions, groupings, and other Crunch attributes to the Crunch dataset. It also adds variables and exports a `.dta` version


More scripts in `00_prepare` format other datasets like NOMINATE, CQ, and DIME.
