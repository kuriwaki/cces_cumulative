\bigskip

This dataset combines 16 years (2006 -- 2021) of the Cooperative
Congressional Election Study (CCES), renamed the Cooperative
Congressional Election Study (CES) from 2020. The CCES/CES is an online
survey conducted around November of each year, asking a range of
questions on political behavior and public opinion. Its principal
investigators are Stephen Ansolabehere, Sam Luks, and Brian Schaffner.

\bigskip

Each year's CCES/CES asks hundreds of questions, many of which change
from year to year. This cumulative file only includes \emph{a subset} of
those questions that are standard and important. It standardizes
(harmonizes) its values across years and creates a few new variables
too. Users can still merge in their year-specific questions of interest
easily into this cumulative file and take advantage of its standardized
variables.

\bigskip

I constructed this dataset from each year's full CCES/CES, all of them
publicly available as separate datasets on
\href{cces.gov.harvard.edu}{Dataverse}.The final product is a
\texttt{tibble}-style data frame (built in R) that is also available as
a Stata \texttt{dta} file. In addition, the same dataset is available on
\texttt{Crunch}, an analytics interface optimized for survey datasets.
The source code is open-source.

\bigskip

Please note that this cumulative dataset makes some modifications to the
original CCES/CES datasets to maintain comparability across years. These
modifications are only made when differences are deemed sufficiently
minor. Still, for details on the survey methodology and a list of all
questions, readers should consult the guides for each year.

\section{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

\hypertarget{data-read-in}{%
\subsection{Data Read-in}\label{data-read-in}}

The \texttt{.Rds} format can be read into R. This format preserves
dataset properties such as the distinction between integers and doubles,
and labelled variables.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cc }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cumulative\_2006{-}2020.Rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent The dataset in R is best viewed with \texttt{dplyr}, although
it can also be used without tidyverse.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\NormalTok{cc}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent  A Stata dta version is provided as well.
\texttt{cumulative\_2006-2020.dta} can be read by Stata, or in R by the
\texttt{haven} package

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(haven)}
\NormalTok{cc }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_dta}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cumulative\_2006{-}2020.dta"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

R is free software and, if necessary, the \texttt{haven} and
\texttt{readr} package can be used to export the CCES/CES datasets in
other formats such as plain-text csv or SPSS sav files. Plain-text
formats are somewhat less convenient because they do not preserve value
labels.

\hypertarget{data-download}{%
\subsection{Data Download}\label{data-download}}

\noindent \emph{Downloading the data via R.} In some cases, it may be
convenient to download the dataset directly into an R environment
without downloading the file to one's computer. The recent version of
\texttt{dataverse} (version 0.3.0 or later) allows this by the function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(dataverse)}
\NormalTok{cc }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{get\_dataframe\_by\_name}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{filename =} \StringTok{"cumulative\_2006{-}2020.dta"}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{dataset =} \StringTok{"10.7910/DVN/II2DB6"}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{original =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
  \AttributeTok{.f =}\NormalTok{ haven}\SpecialCharTok{::}\NormalTok{read\_dta,}
  \AttributeTok{server =} \StringTok{"dataverse.harvard.edu"}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{unique-identifiers-and-how-to-add-more-variables}{%
\subsection{Unique identifiers and how to add more
variables}\label{unique-identifiers-and-how-to-add-more-variables}}

The cumulative dataset only uses key variables from each year's common
content. But users can still merge in other common content variables, or
variables from other CCES datasets like the policy preferences
dataset\footnote{Dagonel, Angelo, 2021, ``Cumulative CCES Policy Preferences'', \href{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OSXDQO}{\url{doi:10.7910/DVN/OSXDQO}}, Harvard Dataverse.}.

In R, we recommend using the \texttt{left\_join} or \texttt{inner\_join}
functions (or the base-R \texttt{merge} function). In Stata, use
\texttt{merge\ 1:1}. In all cases, the combination of \texttt{year} and
\texttt{case\_id} \textbf{uniquely identifies each row} in the
cumulative common content, so any merges should merge on year and the
case identifier. For example, suppose we have separately downloaded the
\href{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GDF6Z0/JPMOZZ}{2016 Common Content}
and read it in as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cc16 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_dta}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"CCES16\_Common\_OUTPUT\_Feb2018\_VV.dta"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Suppose we want to merge in the 2016-specific issue questions that ask
respondent's views about key votes in Congress. This variable all start
with \texttt{"CC16\_351"} and the case-identifier is called
\texttt{V101}, so we can merge this into the cumulative file as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# subset}
\NormalTok{cc16\_rc }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc16, V101, }\FunctionTok{matches}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"CC16\_351"}\NormalTok{))}

\CommentTok{\# join on case ID}
\NormalTok{cc\_rc }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ cc }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(year }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{2016}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{left\_join}\NormalTok{(cc16\_rc, }\AttributeTok{by =} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"case\_id"} \OtherTok{=} \StringTok{"V101"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{labelled-variables-for-analysis-in-r}{%
\subsection{Labelled variables (for analysis in
R)}\label{labelled-variables-for-analysis-in-r}}

A note on variable types. The R dataset stores variables in
\texttt{numeric}, \texttt{character}, \texttt{factor}, or
\texttt{labelled} class.\footnote{Technically, this is now called a
  \texttt{labelled\_haven} class, to disambiguate from an unrelated but
  older use of \texttt{labelled} in the Hmisc package.} The first three
classes are commonly used, but the \texttt{lablelled} format is more
novel. \texttt{labelled} classes are numeric integers where each integer
is associated with a label (See vignette
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html}{here}).
This makes it equivalent to a \texttt{factor} but referenceable by its
numeric value. It is essentially the labels in Stata and SPSS.

A labelled variable's labels are usually not shown. But recent versions
of the \texttt{haven} package (version 2.1.0 or above) will display the
associated labels in the Console if selected within tidyverse. This
makes it immediately obvious which value is associated with which label:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case\_id, pid3)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 531,755 x 3
    year case_id            pid3
   <int>   <int>       <int+lbl>
 1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat]   
 2  2006  439224 4 [Other]      
 3  2006  439228 1 [Democrat]   
 4  2006  439237 1 [Democrat]   
 5  2006  439238 1 [Democrat]   
 6  2006  439242 3 [Independent]
 7  2006  439251 2 [Republican] 
 8  2006  439254 1 [Democrat]   
 9  2006  439255 1 [Democrat]   
10  2006  439263 1 [Democrat]   
# ... with 531,745 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Labels can be made explicit by coercing the labelled vector
into a factor. However, this removes the numerical value codes of the
labelled class.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(haven)}
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case\_id, pid3) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{pid3\_fct =} \FunctionTok{as\_factor}\NormalTok{(pid3))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 531,755 x 4
   year case_id         pid3 pid3_fct
  <int>   <int>    <int+lbl> <fct>   
1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat] Democrat
2  2006  439224 4 [Other]    Other   
3  2006  439228 1 [Democrat] Democrat
4  2006  439237 1 [Democrat] Democrat
5  2006  439238 1 [Democrat] Democrat
# ... with 531,750 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Unlike factors, labelled variables can be referenced by their
underlying numeric value. It is sometimes useful to treat survey values
as numbers rather than as raw text, and the labelled class allows you to
do that.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case\_id, pid3) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(pid3 }\SpecialCharTok{==} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 192,495 x 3
   year case_id         pid3
  <int>   <int>    <int+lbl>
1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat]
2  2006  439228 1 [Democrat]
3  2006  439237 1 [Democrat]
4  2006  439238 1 [Democrat]
5  2006  439254 1 [Democrat]
# ... with 192,490 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\indent In this cumulative (R) dataset, some variables are of class
labelled, and some are of factor class. This is because the latter
variables were different enough in their value codings across years that
summarizing them into a single numeric value was difficult.

\newpage

\hypertarget{features-of-the-cumulative-dataset}{%
\section{Features of the Cumulative
Dataset}\label{features-of-the-cumulative-dataset}}

Beyond stacking together each year's common content, the cumulative
dataset provides several additional features to facilitate analysis.

\hypertarget{unified-variable-names}{%
\subsection{Unified Variable Names}\label{unified-variable-names}}

Most variables in this dataset come straight from each year's CCES/CES.
However, it renames and standardizes variable names, making them
accessible in one place. Please see the rest of this guide or the Crunch
dataset for a full list and description of variables.

\hypertarget{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}{%
\subsection{Chosen Candidate Names and
Identifiers}\label{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}}

One addition to this cumulative dataset are variables of candidate names
and identifiers that a respondent chose. In the individual year's
CCES/CES datasets, typically the response values for a vote choice
question is a generic label, e.g., \texttt{Candidate1} and
\texttt{Candidate2}. Then, separate variables of names and parties
correspond to each \texttt{Candidate1} and \texttt{Candidate2}.

Instead, the cumulative dataset shows both the generic label \emph{and}
the chosen candidate's name and party, which will vary across
individuals.

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\section{Variables}\label{variables}}

The sections below provide summary statistics and more information on
each variable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The title shows the name of the variable as it appears in the dataset
  (``alias'' in Crunch terminology), followed by a more descriptive name
  suitable for presentation (``name'' in Crunch terminology).
\item
  Question wordings, where applicable, immediately follow. Otherwise a
  description is provided in square brackets (\texttt{{[}\ \ {]}}). All
  square brackets, both in the description and the response options,
  indicate descriptions that are summaries rather than the question
  verbatim.
\item
  A tabulation of response options (or summary statistics for numeric
  variables) follows. Numbers are unweighted counts.
\item
  The ``Years'' bullet lists the years of the CCES in which data on the
  variable is available at all. If a year is not listed, either the
  question was not asked in the year or was not incorporated in the
  creation of this dataset.
\item
  Finally, the ``Limitations'' bullet notes some of the caveats required
  when interpreting this variable. As this dataset is a combination of
  different surveys, some year-specific details on implementation are
  inevitably lost. For example, for all 2016 responses ``Not Asked'' and

  Specifically, \texttt{weight\_cumulative} is \texttt{weight} divided
  by the year-specific factors shown in the following table. For
  example, all weights in the 2016 common content are divided by about
  1.97, because it has about twice as many observations as the other
  datasets.
\item
  This transformation means that this simple cumulative weight makes
  sense when all years should be re-weighted to have the same sample
  size, even if that means doubling the weights. For analyses that are
  done year by year, using \texttt{weight} and
  \texttt{weight\_cumulative} are equivalent.

  To analyze the post-election wave responses for years that do not have
  a post-specific weight, the second-best option is to use the normal
  \texttt{weight} variable. These weights will not be designed for the
  post-wave subset but they tend to correlate. When applying the weights
  to a subset of the data, make sure that they are rescaled to mean 1 in
  the non-missing subset (most statistical software will do this
  automatically).
\item
  To use the \texttt{weight\_post} for years it is available but
  \texttt{weight} for where it is not, one could coalesce into a new
  variable.

  Note the distinction between \texttt{dist} and \texttt{dist\_up},
  especially in 2012. The former should generally be used for linking
  respondents to their representatives at the time of the survey,
  whereas the latter can be used for the district in which they will
  vote for. New districts were drawn in 2010-2012 and candidates ran in
  new district maps in the 2012 CCES. Because respondents would not be
  \emph{represented} in the new district lines until January 2013, in
  the 2012 CCES \texttt{dist} is the old district line and
  \texttt{dist\_up} is the new district line for the General Election.
\item
  \texttt{zipcode} mostly relies on the variable often called
  \texttt{lookupzip} in each year's CCES. This is the zipcode of voter
  registration, or if not available, the residential zipcode, of the
  respondent. It is called lookup because it is used to look up the
  congressional district and other geographies of the respondent. For
  more information on zipcodes, see the CCES question.
\item
  Limitations: Some years do not provide the variable relevant to
  \texttt{dist\_up}, in which case the current district (\texttt{dist})
  is assigned automatically. Thus, \texttt{dist\_up} may not reflect
  district changes in off-cycle redistricting. Only residence (not
  registration) geographies included here; see individual years' for
  registration geographies.

\subsection{Vote Choice Variables}\label{vote-choice-variables}}

\paragraph{A note on the terms "\texttt{intent}" and "\texttt{voted}":}

In this dataset we make the distinction between ``intent'' /
``preference'' vs.~``voted'' / ``vote choice''. ``Intent'' (or
``preference'') refers to the response to the prospective question of
the sort ``who would you vote for?'' in the \emph{pre-election} wave.
``Vote choice'' refers to the response to the retrospective question of
the sort ``in the election this November, who did you vote for?''

Response to the vote choice questions coalesces both
\emph{post-election} wave responses (the bulk of the responses) and
pre-election respondents who reported having already voted early. In
2018, it also coalesces the responses to the straight ticket party
option (\texttt{CC18\_409}), so that those who selected the Republican
straight party ticket in the applicable states will appear to have voted
for the Republican candidate in all offices. The straight ticket party
option was not asked in other years.

The category ``Did Not Vote'' is recorded only when the respondent
selects that option. Respondents who have missing values for intent or
vote choice can also be non-voters for a variety of reasons. For general
turnout, see the section on turnout.

\hypertarget{metadata-and-identifiers}{%
\section{Metadata and Identifiers}\label{metadata-and-identifiers}}

\hypertarget{identifiers}{%
\subsection{Identifiers}\label{identifiers}}

The case identifier \texttt{case\_id} is unique within the year and is
identical to the case identifiers in the individual year's CCES. It
should be used in conjunction with \texttt{year} for a unique identifier
for the whole dataset. Some individuals across years may be the same
YouGov panel respondent with different identifiers; for example the 2007
CCES draws from the 2006 CCES respondents.

\begin{verbatim}
Rows: 531,755
Columns: 2
$ year    <int> 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 20~
$ case_id <int> 439219, 439224, 439228, 439237, 439238, 439242, 439251, 439254~
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{current-representatives-name-and-party}{%
\subsection{Current Representatives' Name and
Party}\label{current-representatives-name-and-party}}

The four names in the three offices are representatives of the
respondent \emph{at the time of the survey}. Names are printed as shown,
and similarly parties are shown if the particular year's CCES did not
show party. For example, Senator Shelby is presented as
\texttt{Richard\ Craig\ Shelby}, \texttt{Richard\ C.\ Shelby\ (R)},
\texttt{Richard\ Shelby\ (R)}, \texttt{Richard\ C.\ Shelby\ (R)},
depending on the year. Party names are abbreviated down to initials
(\texttt{D} for Democrat, \texttt{R} for Republican, \texttt{I} for
Independent) in this dataset.

Because of the changes in naming by year, users should not assume that
\texttt{rep\_current} and \texttt{voted\_rep\_chosen} of a given
respondent should be named the same way.

\begin{verbatim}
Rows: 531,755
Columns: 4
$ rep_current  <chr> "Patrick T. McHenry (R)", "Michael R. Turner (R)", "Rober~
$ sen1_current <chr> "Elizabeth Dole (R)", "Mike DeWine (R)", "Robert Menendez~
$ sen2_current <chr> "Richard Burr (R)", "George V. Voinovich (R)", "Frank R. ~
$ gov_current  <chr> "Michael Easley (D)", "Bob Taft (R)", "Jon Corzine (D)", ~
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{icpsr-identifiers}{%
\subsection{ICPSR Identifiers}\label{icpsr-identifiers}}

Unique identifiers (ICPSR / Nominate for Congress, FEC for Governor) for
the current representatives. Identifiers are not part of the individual
year's CCES. Instead, I attempt to merge in these identifiers through a
series of name and district merges.

The matching of identifiers to respondent occurs through matching by
district, by district and last name, or both:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For House representatives, we join on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and
  \texttt{dist} to a NOMINATE database that only consists of unique
  observations according to the key. For duplicates with regards to
  these three variables (e.g., in the rare case where a new
  representative comes into office mid-session), we match on
  \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, \texttt{dist} and last name.
\item
  For Senators, we join entirely on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and last
  name
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Rows: 531,755
Columns: 3
$ rep_icpsr  <dbl> 20522, 20342, 29132, 29911, 29380, 20531, 29126, 29739, 205~
$ sen1_icpsr <dbl> 40303, 15020, 29373, 15021, 14858, 49306, 40101, 15054, 493~
$ sen2_icpsr <dbl> 29548, 49903, 14914, 40502, 40105, 40305, 40302, 29537, 403~
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Years: All of 2006-2020
\item
  Limitations: Please note there may be some incorrect merges,
  especially for nontraditional names and representatives who were
  elected in special elections and may not be in some datasets.
\end{itemize}

The unique identifiers can be used to join with other databases to
append additional information such as committee membership and ideology
scores, such as

\begin{quote}
Lewis, Jeffrey B., Keith Poole, Howard Rosenthal, Adam Boche, Aaron
Rudkin, and Luke Sonnet (2017). Voteview: Congressional Roll-Call Votes
Database. \url{https://voteview.com/}
\end{quote}

The text responses that the respondent chose in each of the
\texttt{intent\_} / \texttt{voted\_} questions, if the respondent was a
candidate. For example, respondent with \texttt{case\_id\ =\ 163051575}
in the 2012 CCES chose the first option in the House representative
preference question. \texttt{intent\_rep\_chosen} shows that this
particular respondent preferred voting for Maxine Waters, one of the two
Democrats in the race.
