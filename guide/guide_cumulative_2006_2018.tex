\noindent This dataset combines twelve years (2006 - 2018) of the
Cooperative Congressional Election Study (Principal Investigators:
Stephen Ansolabehere, Sam Luks, Brian Schaffner).

The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) is an online survey
conducted around November of each year, asking a range of questions on
political behavior and public opinion. Questions can change from year to
year; this cumulative file includes standard questions asked multiple
years.

This dataset was constructed based off CCES datasets from each year. A
set of R scripts formatted, merged, and standardized these datasets to
generate a \texttt{tibble}-style data frame. In addition, the same
dataset is available on \texttt{Crunch}, an accessible analytics
interface optimized for survey datasets.

Please note that this cumulative dataset makes modifications to the
original CCES datasets for comparability. These modifications are only
made when differences are deemed sufficiently minor, and are documented
in source code (see below). However, for details on the survey
methodology and a list of all questions, readers should consult the
guides for each year.

The \texttt{.Rds} format can be read into R. This format preserves
dataset properties such as the distinction between integers and doubles,
and labelled variables. Unlike a \texttt{.Rdata} file, an \texttt{.Rds}
file must be assigned to an object when loading.

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{df <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cumulative_2006_2018.Rds"}\NormalTok{)}

The dataset in R is best viewed in \texttt{dplyr}, although it can be
analyzed as a standard data frame.

A Stata dta file is provided as well.
\texttt{cumulative\_2006\_2018.dta} can be read by Stata, or in R by the
\texttt{haven} package

\end{Shaded}

A note on variable types. The R dataset stores variables in
\texttt{numeric}, \texttt{character}, \texttt{factor}, or
\texttt{labelled} format. The first three classes are commonly used, but
the \texttt{lablelled} format is more recent. Essentially it is similar
to a \texttt{factor} but more compatible with Stata and SPSS. It is
built around R's \texttt{haven} package, which includes more
documentation.

A labelled variable's labels are not shown immediately in the Console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(df, year, case_id, pid3)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\subsection{Unified Variable Names}\label{unified-variable-names}}

Most variables in this dataset come straight from each year's CCES.
However, it renames and standardizes variable names, making them
accessible in one place. Please see the rest of this guide or the Crunch
dataset for a full list and description of variables.

\hypertarget{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}{%
\subsection{Chosen Candidate Names and
Identifiers}\label{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}}

One addition to this cumulative dataset are variables of candidate names
and identifiers that a respondent chose. In the individual year's CCES
datasets, typically the response values for a vote choice question is a
generic label, e.g. \texttt{Candidate1} and \texttt{Candidate2}. Then,
separate variables of names and parties correspond to each
\texttt{Candidate1} and \texttt{Candidate2}.

Instead, the cumulative dataset shows both the generic label \emph{and}
the chosen candidate's name, party, and identifier, which will vary
across individuals.

The sections below provide summary more information on each variable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The title shows the name as used in the dataset, suitable for coding
  (``alias'' in Crunch terminology). followed by a more descriptive.
  name suitable for presentation (``name'' in Crunch terminology).
\item
  Question wordings, where applicable, immediately follow. Otherwise an
  description is provide in square brackets (\texttt{{[}\ \ {]}}). All
  square brackets, both in the description and the response options,
  indicate descriptions that are summaries of what the respondent saw
  rather than the question verbatim.
\item
  A tabulation of response options (or summary statistics for numeric
  variables) follow. Numbers are unweighted counts.
\item
  The ``Years'' bullet lists the years of the CCES in which data on the
  variable is available at all. If a year is not listed, either the
  question was not asked in the year or was not incorporated in the
  creation of this dataset.
\item
  Finally, the ``Limitations'' bullet notes some of the caveats required
  when interpreting this variable. As this dataset is combinations of
  different surveys, some year-specific details on implementation are
  inevitably lost. For example, for all 2016 responses ``Not Asked'' and
  ``Skipped'' are both coded as a \texttt{NA} (missing) to stay
  consistent with past years that did not make that finer distinction.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={A note on \texttt{intent} and \texttt{voted}}]
In this dataset we make the distinction between "intent" / "preference" vs. "voted" / "vote choice". "Intent" (or "preference") refers to the response to the prospective question of the sort "who would you vote for?" in the \emph{pre-election} wave. "Vote choice" refers to the response to the retrospective question of the sort "in the election this November, who did you vote for?" Response to the vote choice questions coalesces both \emph{post-election} wave responses (the bulk of the responses) and pre-election respondents who reported having already voted early.

The case identifier \texttt{case\_id} is unique within the year and is
identical to the case identifiers in the individual year's CCES. It
should be used in conjunction with \texttt{year} for a unique identifier
for the whole dataset. Some individuals across years may be the same
YouGov panel respondent with different identifiers; for example the 2007
CCES draws from the 2006 CCES respondents.

\subsubsection{Incumbent Identifiers}\label{incumbent-identifiers}}

Unique identifiers (ICPSR / Nominate for Congress, FEC for Governor) for
the current representatives. Identifiers are not part of the individual
year's CCES but merged on for this cumulative dataset only.

The matching of identifiers to respondent occurs through matching by
district, by district and last name, or both:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For House representatives, we join on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and
  \texttt{dist} to a NOMINATE database that only consists of unique
  observations according to the key. For duplicates with regards to
  these three variables (e.g.~in the rare case where a new
  representative comes into office mid-session), we match on
  \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, \texttt{dist} and last name.
\item
  For Senators, we join entirely on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and last
  name
\item
  For Governors, we join only on \texttt{st} and last name. In this
  period, there are no two governors in the same state that share the
  same last name.
\end{itemize}

The name and party are those as provided in the CCES datasets (e.g.~in
the form \texttt{HouseCand1Name}). The FEC ID is not part of the CCES
but joined in this dataset.

For all three offices, the matching generally occurs by \texttt{year},
\texttt{st}, \texttt{dist\_up} (not \texttt{dist}, because
\texttt{dist\_up}, refers to the district of the upcoming session) and
\texttt{party}. \texttt{party} is the party affiliation as indicated in
the CCES. For years 2008 and 2010, the first option is automatically
labelled as a Democrat and the second option as a Republican, although
these may be inaccurate at times.

The FEC database runs up until 2014 (thus more recent candidates do
\emph{not} get a FEC ID) originates from

\begin{quote}
Bonica, Adam , 2015, ``Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and
Elections (DIME)'', \url{doi:10.7910/DVN/O5PX0B}, Harvard Dataverse, V2
\end{quote}

which helpfully includes candidates office sought, district (for House
members), party affiliation, and cycle in which the candidate filed. The
variable \texttt{cycle} in Bonica's data is used to join on the CCES
dataset's \texttt{year} variable.

Only candidates who are unique within the district and party are
considered for the first join. However, many candidates are not unique
within the district-party, as many co-partisans may file in the same
district. The second matching process thus considers the full name of
the candidate listed in the CCES and the candidates in the FEC database.
\emph{Within} the subset of year, district, and party, a Jaro-Winker
string distance (that ranges from 0 to 1) is computed for both last name
and the first name - middle name. If the sum of the two string distances
are more than 0.2 for all possible combinations, no match is returned.
If there is a unique combination that achieves a unique minimum that is
below 0.2, that combination is declared a match. If there are multiple
matches with the same minimum string distance, one is randomly chosen.
