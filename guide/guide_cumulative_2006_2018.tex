\bigskip

This dataset combines thirteen years (2006 - 2018) of the Cooperative
Congressional Election Study (CCES). The CCES is an online survey
conducted around November of each year, asking a range of questions on
political behavior and public opinion. Its principal investigators are
Stephen Ansolabehere, Sam Luks, and Brian Schaffner.

\bigskip

CCES questions change from year to year, so this cumulative file only
includes a subset of those questions that are standard. Users can still
merge in year-specific questions easily into this cumulative file and
take advantage of its harmonized variables.

\bigskip

This dataset was constructed from CCES datasets from each year. The
final product is a \texttt{tibble}-style data frame (built in R) that is
also available as a Stata \texttt{dta} file. In addition, the same
dataset is available on \texttt{Crunch}, an analytics interface
optimized for survey datasets.

\bigskip

Please note that this cumulative dataset makes some modifications to the
original CCES datasets for comparability. These modifications are only
made when differences are deemed sufficiently minor, and are documented
in source code (see below). However, for details on the survey
methodology and a list of all questions, readers should consult the
guides for each year.

\section{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

The \texttt{.Rds} format can be read into R. This format preserves
dataset properties such as the distinction between integers and doubles,
and labelled variables. Unlike a \texttt{.Rdata} file, an \texttt{.Rds}
file is assigned to an object.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cumulative_2006_2018.Rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent The dataset in R is best viewed with \texttt{dplyr}, although
it can also be used without tidyverse.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\NormalTok{cc}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent  A Stata dta version is provided as well.
\texttt{cumulative\_2006\_2018.dta} can be read by Stata, or in R by the
\texttt{haven} package

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(haven)}
\NormalTok{cc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read_dta}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cumulative_2006_2018.dta"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{labelled-variables-for-analysis-in-r}{%
\subsection{Labelled variables (for analysis in
R)}\label{labelled-variables-for-analysis-in-r}}

A note on variable types. The R dataset stores variables in
\texttt{numeric}, \texttt{character}, \texttt{factor}, or
\texttt{labelled} class.\footnote{Technically, this is now called a
  \texttt{labelled\_haven} class, to disambiguate from an unrelated but
  older use of \texttt{labelled} in the Hmisc package.} The first three
classes are commonly used, but the \texttt{lablelled} format is more
novel. \texttt{labelled} classes are numeric integers where each integer
is associated with a label (See vignette
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html}{here}).
This makes it equivalent to a \texttt{factor} but referenceable by its
numeric value. It is essentially the labels in Stata and SPSS.

A labelled variable's labels are usually not shown. But recent versions
of the \texttt{haven} package (version 2.1.0 or above) will display the
associated labels in the Console if selected within tidyverse. This
makes it immediately obvious which value is associated with which label:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case_id, pid3)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 452,755 x 3
    year case_id            pid3
   <int>   <int>       <int+lbl>
 1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat]   
 2  2006  439224 4 [Other]      
 3  2006  439228 1 [Democrat]   
 4  2006  439237 1 [Democrat]   
 5  2006  439238 1 [Democrat]   
 6  2006  439242 3 [Independent]
 7  2006  439251 2 [Republican] 
 8  2006  439254 1 [Democrat]   
 9  2006  439255 1 [Democrat]   
10  2006  439263 1 [Democrat]   
# ... with 452,745 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Labels can be made explicit by coercing the labelled vector
into a factor. However, this removes the numerical value codes of the
labelled class.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(haven)}
\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case_id, pid3) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{pid3_fct =} \KeywordTok{as_factor}\NormalTok{(pid3))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 452,755 x 4
   year case_id         pid3 pid3_fct
  <int>   <int>    <int+lbl> <fct>   
1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat] Democrat
2  2006  439224 4 [Other]    Other   
3  2006  439228 1 [Democrat] Democrat
4  2006  439237 1 [Democrat] Democrat
5  2006  439238 1 [Democrat] Democrat
# ... with 4.528e+05 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Unlike factors, labelled variables can be referenced by their
underlying numeric value. It is sometimes useful to treat survey values
as numbers rather than as raw text, and the labelled calss allows you to
do that.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(cc, year, case_id, pid3) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{filter}\NormalTok{(pid3 }\OperatorTok{==}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 160,637 x 3
   year case_id         pid3
  <int>   <int>    <int+lbl>
1  2006  439219 1 [Democrat]
2  2006  439228 1 [Democrat]
3  2006  439237 1 [Democrat]
4  2006  439238 1 [Democrat]
5  2006  439254 1 [Democrat]
# ... with 1.606e+05 more rows
\end{verbatim}

\indent In this cumulative (R) dataset, some variables are of class
labelled, and some are of factor class. This is because the latter
variables were different enough in their value codings across years that
summarizing them into a single numeric value was difficult.

\hypertarget{adding-more-variables}{%
\subsection{Adding more variables}\label{adding-more-variables}}

As noted, the cumulative dataset only uses key variables from each
year's common content. However,common content variables can be merged
in.

In R, one could use the \texttt{merge} or \texttt{left\_join} functions.
Here is sample code for merging with the latter. In Stata, one could use
\texttt{merge\ 1:1}. In all cases, \texttt{year} and \texttt{case\_id}
\textbf{uniquely identifies each row} in the cumulative common content,
so merges should merge on year and the case identifier.

\newpage

\hypertarget{features-of-the-cumulative-dataset}{%
\section{Features of the Cumulative
Dataset}\label{features-of-the-cumulative-dataset}}

Beyond stacking together each year's common content, the cumulative
dataset provides several additional features to facilitate analysis.

\hypertarget{unified-variable-names}{%
\subsection{Unified Variable Names}\label{unified-variable-names}}

Most variables in this dataset come straight from each year's CCES.
However, it renames and standardizes variable names, making them
accessible in one place. Please see the rest of this guide or the Crunch
dataset for a full list and description of variables.

\hypertarget{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}{%
\subsection{Chosen Candidate Names and
Identifiers}\label{chosen-candidate-names-and-identifiers}}

One addition to this cumulative dataset are variables of candidate names
and identifiers that a respondent chose. In the individual year's CCES
datasets, typically the response values for a vote choice question is a
generic label, e.g. \texttt{Candidate1} and \texttt{Candidate2}. Then,
separate variables of names and parties correspond to each
\texttt{Candidate1} and \texttt{Candidate2}.

Instead, the cumulative dataset shows both the generic label \emph{and}
the chosen candidate's name and party, which will vary across
individuals.

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\section{Variables}\label{variables}}

The sections below provide summary statistics and more information on
each variable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The title shows the name of the variable as it appears in the dataset
  (``alias'' in Crunch terminology), followed by a more descriptive name
  suitable for presentation (``name'' in Crunch terminology).
\item
  Question wordings, where applicable, immediately follow. Otherwise a
  description is provided in square brackets (\texttt{{[}\ \ {]}}). All
  square brackets, both in the description and the response options,
  indicate descriptions that are summaries rather than the question
  verbatim.
\item
  A tabulation of response options (or summary statistics for numeric
  variables) follow. Numbers are unweighted counts.
\item
  The ``Years'' bullet lists the years of the CCES in which data on the
  variable is available at all. If a year is not listed, either the
  question was not asked in the year or was not incorporated in the
  creation of this dataset.
\item
  Finally, the ``Limitations'' bullet notes some of the caveats required
  when interpreting this variable. As this dataset is combinations of
  different surveys, some year-specific details on implementation are
  inevitably lost. For example, for all 2016 responses ``Not Asked'' and
  ``Skipped'' are both coded as a \texttt{NA} (missing) to stay
  consistent with past years that did not make that finer distinction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{A note on the terms "\texttt{intent}" and "\texttt{voted}":}

In this dataset we make the distinction between ``intent'' /
``preference'' vs. ``voted'' / ``vote choice''. ``Intent'' (or
``preference'') refers to the response to the prospective question of
the sort ``who would you vote for?'' in the \emph{pre-election} wave.
``Vote choice'' refers to the response to the retrospective question of
the sort ``in the election this November, who did you vote for?''

Response to the vote choice questions coalesces both
\emph{post-election} wave responses (the bulk of the responses) and
pre-election respondents who reported having already voted early. In
2018, it also coalesces the responses to the straight ticket party
option, so that those who selected the Republican straight party ticket
in the applicable states will appear to have voted for the Republican
candidate in all offices. The straight ticket party option was not asked
in other years.

  pre-election wave if the respondent indicates they have already voted,
  or if not, the response in the post-election wave.
\item
  See \texttt{voted\_gov\_party} for party affiliation.

\hypertarget{identifiers}{%
\subsection{Identifiers}\label{identifiers}}

The case identifier \texttt{case\_id} is unique within the year and is
identical to the case identifiers in the individual year's CCES. It
should be used in conjunction with \texttt{year} for a unique identifier
for the whole dataset. Some individuals across years may be the same
YouGov panel respondent with different identifiers; for example the 2007
CCES draws from the 2006 CCES respondents.

\begin{verbatim}
Observations: 452,755
Variables: 2
$ year    <int> 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, 2006, ...
$ case_id <int> 439219, 439224, 439228, 439237, 439238, 439242, 439251...
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{current-representatives-name-and-party}{%
\subsection{Current Representatives' Name and
Party}\label{current-representatives-name-and-party}}

The four names in the three offices are representatives of the
respondent \emph{at the time of the survey}. Names are printed as shown,
and similarly parties are shown if the particular year's CCES did not
show party. For example, Senator Shelby is presented as
\texttt{Richard\ Craig\ Shelby}, \texttt{Richard\ C.\ Shelby\ (R)},
\texttt{Richard\ Shelby\ (R)}, \texttt{Richard\ C.\ Shelby\ (R)},
depending on the year. Party names are abbreviated down to initials
(\texttt{D} for Democrat, \texttt{R} for Republican, \texttt{I} for
Independent) in this dataset.

\hypertarget{icpsr-identifiers}{%
\subsection{ICPSR Identifiers}\label{icpsr-identifiers}}

Unique identifiers (ICPSR / Nominate for Congress, FEC for Governor) for
the current representatives. Identifiers are not part of the individual
year's CCES. Instead, I attempt to merge in these identifiers through a
series of name and district merges.

The matching of identifiers to respondent occurs through matching by
district, by district and last name, or both:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For House representatives, we join on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and
  \texttt{dist} to a NOMINATE database that only consists of unique
  observations according to the key. For duplicates with regards to
  these three variables (e.g.~in the rare case where a new
  representative comes into office mid-session), we match on
  \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, \texttt{dist} and last name.
\item
  For Senators, we join entirely on \texttt{cong}, \texttt{st}, and last
  name
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
Observations: 452,755
Variables: 3
$ rep_icpsr  <dbl> 20522, 20342, 29132, 29911, 29380, 20531, 29126, 29...

$ sen2_icpsr <dbl> 29548, 49903, 14914, 40502, 40105, 40305, 40302, 29...
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Years: All of 2006-2018
\item
  Limitations: Please note there may be some incorrect merges,
  especially for nontraditional names and representatives who were
  elected in special elections and may not be in some datasets.
\end{itemize}

The unique identifiers can be used to join with other databases to
append additional information such as committee membership and ideology
scores, such as

\begin{quote}
Lewis, Jeffrey B., Keith Poole, Howard Rosenthal, Adam Boche, Aaron
Rudkin, and Luke Sonnet (2017). Voteview: Congressional Roll-Call Votes
Database. \url{https://voteview.com/}
\end{quote}

The text responses that the respondent chose in each of the
\texttt{intent\_} / \texttt{voted\_} questions, if the respondent was a
candidate. For example, respondent with \texttt{case\_id\ =\ 163051575}
in the 2012 CCES chose the first option in the House representative
preference question. \texttt{intent\_rep\_chosen} shows that this
particular respondent preferred voting for Maxine Waters, one of the two
Democrats in the race.
